# Odin Restaurant

This webpack-based restaurant app was made as part of The Odin Project curriculum.
It showcases the 34th Street Caf√©, a fictional restaurant that serves Christmas-themed lunch and dessert dishes year round.

Switch between the site's tabs, all populated inside a common template. The contact form validates like a real form, but it does not actually send any data.

This mock site is live on Github Pages, here: [Restaurant App by McKathlin](https://mckathlin.github.io/odin-restaurant/)
